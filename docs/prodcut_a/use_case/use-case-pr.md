# Contribute Kernel to FlagGems

This use case introduces how to contribute the KernelGen generated **Kernel**, **CUDA Implementation**, **Correctness Test**, and **Speedup Ratio Test** codes to [FlagGems](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems) GitHub.

The process is as follows:

1. Generate **Kernel**, **CUDA Implementation**, **Correctness Test**, and **Speedup Ratio Test** codes. For more information, see [](../user_guide/generate-triton-kernels-through-your-operator-definitions.md).
2. Save the codes as files, respectively.
3. Convert the files.
4. Contribute the conveted file to FlagGems GitHub.

```{note}
The predefined use case **ReLU** in KernelGen is used as an example. In this use case, we assume that the ReLU operator is a new operator you just generated though KernelGen but you have not contributed it to FlagGems GitHub.
```

## Convert files generated from KernelGen

To convert files generate from KernelGen:

1. Rename the four files as follows:

   - `relu_triton.py`: This file includes the **Kernel** code.
   - `relu_baseline.py`: This file includes the **CUDA Implementation** code.
   - `test_relu_accuracy.py`: This file includes the **Correctness Test** code.
   - `test_relu_performance.py`: This file includes the **Speedup Ratio Test** code.

2. Clone the FlagGems GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems
    ```

3. Clone the KernelGen GitHub repository。

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/KernelGen
    ```

3. Navigate to the `tools` directory of the KernelGen project.

    ```bash
    cd /your/project/KernelGen/tools
    ```

4. Run the following script to convert these files into two FlagGems-compatible files.

    ```bash
    python kernelgen_to_flaggems.py \
        ./tests \
        ./output \
        relu
    ```

    The converted files are as follows:

    - `/tmp/output/relu.py`: Includes the Kernel code. This code is the same as it in KernelGen.
    - `/tmp/output/relu_test.py`: Includes the converted Correctness test and Speedup Ratio codes.

## Create a pull request in FlagGems github

You can now create a pull request in [FlagGems](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems) GitHub.

Ensure the two converted files are placed properly as follows:

- Place the `relu.py` file at:
  `src/flag_gems/experimental_ops`
- Place the `relu_test.py` file at:
  `src/flag_gems/experimental_ops/exp_tests`
