# KernelGen Overview

  KernelGen is an operator auto-generation tool. KernelGen is designed to construct operator definitions through natural language prompts, retrieve existing similar operator definitions, automatically execute operator accuracy and performance testing, generate accuracy and performance test results, and produce Kernels.

- If you are a starter that wants to quickly play with KernelGen, you can start with *KernelGen Overview* and *Getting Started*.

- If you are an operator developer, you can directly start from *User Guide*.
