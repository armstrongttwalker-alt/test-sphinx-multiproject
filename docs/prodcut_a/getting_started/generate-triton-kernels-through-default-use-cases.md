# Generate Kernels through predefined use cases

After signing in to KernelGen, you will see the welcome page.

On the welcome page, perform the following steps to generate Triton
Kernels:

1. Click a predefined use case in the **Use Case** section.

   This example uses the predefined use case named **ReLU**.

   The operator definitions of the **ReLU** use case are automatically populated in the text box.

2. Click ![alt text](../assets/icons/right-arrow.png){w=20px}.

   KernelGen searches for a list of GitHub repositories to find code snippets similar to the operator definitions. For more information about the list of GitHub repositories, [](../search-repo-list.md).

3. Select one or more URLs of repositories for reference or select the direct generation checkbox, and then click **Next**.

4. In the confirmation dialogue box, click **Confirm**.

5. On the operator definition and configuration page, configure the operator definition parameters and the maximum number of iterations KernelGen attempts to pass the correctness test:

   {style=lower-alpha}

   1. In the **Operator Definition** section, select an operator testing device from the **Testing Device** dropdown list.  The default is **Nvidia**.
   2. Configure the other operator definition parameters as needed.
   3. In the **KernelGen Configuration** section, increase or decrease the maximum number of iterations KernelGen attempts to pass the correctness test. The default is **5**. 
   4. Click **Next**.
   5. In the confirmation dialogue box, click **Confirm**.

6. On the Kernel generation and test page, check the generation status on the **KernelGen** panel at the right.

7. After the statuses of the **Kernel**, **CUDA Implementation**, **Correctness Test**, and **Speedup Ratio Test** change to **Completed**, and the **Correctness Test** is passed (turns to green), click **View Details**. The **Speedup Ratio Details** table lists speedup of each scenario and overall speedup.

8. If the speedup information meets your performance criteria, close the **Speedup Ratio Details**, and click **Download Kernel**. If you want to use the correctness test and speedup ratio test results, click the **Correctness Test** and **Speedup Ratio Test** sections to copy and paste the corresponding codes.
